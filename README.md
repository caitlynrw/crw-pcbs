# CRW PCBs

Collection of random PCBs that I've made but aren't connected to any sort of big project.

Schematics and PCBs designed in [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/)

These designs are provided as is and I take no responsibility if it breaks anything in real life. I am not a qualified electronic engineer (yet...)
